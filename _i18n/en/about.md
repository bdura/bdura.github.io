My name is Basile Dura. I am about to graduate from Mila, the institute for learning algorithms located in Montréal and founded by Turing Award recipient Yoshua Bengio.

Deeply interested in artificial intelligence, I am looking for ways to put the technology to good use. I recently finished an internship at [InVivo AI](https://invivoai.com/), a Montréal-based startup where I worked to bring few-shot learning to drug discovery and unlock small & noisy datasets.
