My name is Basile Dura. I recently graduated from Mila, the institute for learning algorithms located in Montréal and founded by Turing Award recipient Yoshua Bengio.

Deeply interested in artificial intelligence and how it can benefit the many, I just started a mission at Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a cluster of thirty-nine university hospitals in Paris. There, I work in the data science team, using AI to accelerate health care and medical research.
