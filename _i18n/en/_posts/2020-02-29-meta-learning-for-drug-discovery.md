I finished my master's degree at Mila & Université de Montréal with an internship at [InVivo AI](https://invivoai.com/), a Montréal-based startup and Mila affiliate. There, I worked as a research intern to bring few-shot learning to drug discovery and wrote a report detailing the state-of-the-art in the field as well as the research led at InVivo AI.

You can find the full report [here](/assets/files/Meta-learning for drug discovery.pdf). It is divided into four parts:

1. First, I give a succinct presentation of a typical drug discovery pipeline and discuss how machine-learning could help, as well as propose a set of desiderata for a drug-discovery algorithm.

2. Then, I look at how traditional machine-learning has started to yield some results.

3. Third, I argue that given the scarcity and noise of training data, the answer may lie in learning from multiple tasks and present a relatively new machine-learning paradigm, namely _meta-learning_.

4. Finally, I describe one particular project that I worked on during the internship, namely "Adaptive Deep Kernel Learning", a method we proposed to address the desiderata formulated to work with molecular data.
